In this example we want to emulate a company with executives that are authorized to buy stuff for the company

Procurement Manager (10 000) ---> VicePrecident (25 000)   ---> CEO  (100 000)

If someone want to buy something cost more than 100 000 then the CEO needs to call an executive meeting and 
get the approval from the entire management team to make the purshase
